### About the Project
The overall intention of this repo is to show a `RAG` implementation together with `in-context learning`.

We are using pinecone vector database and `GPT-3.5-Turbo`.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have installed the libraries in `requirements.txt` which is located in the `.\Team10\source\requirements.txt`.
You can run this code from terminal:
```py
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that you put OpenAI and Pinecone API key into .env file.
### Steps to Run
The code is ready for use, you can run it, and you will be prompted to ask questions about the dummy data.
The dummy data is a PDF about cloud computing located in the `.\Team10\data\cc.pdf`.
